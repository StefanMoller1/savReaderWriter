* Fix spssSetDateVariables wrapper to set SPSS Trends info
* Upgrade to SPSS v22 I/O libraries --> not much added benefit
-pro: work with encrypted sav files (only useful for SPSS v22 users)
-con: needs LD_LIBRARY_PATH to be set, lin32 & HP-UX libs were missing!
* Make code faster, tidier after Py2-3 in codebase
* Use ctypes.argtypes for every function that user can call
-prevents ugly segfaults in case of wrong specification by user
-prevents annoying warnings by test runners
